## What is Reef's mission?
Reef's mission is to make DeFi, NFTs and games easy and accessible to more people.

## What is Reef token?
Reef Token is the native currency on Reef Chain, and is used for transaction fees (gas) and on-chain goverance (NPoS and PoC). Reef token is also available as ERC-20 on Ethereum and BSC and are convertible 1:1 with native Reef chain tokens.

## Is Reef chain PoW?
Reef chain is **not** incumbered by Proof of Waste. Furthermore, smart contract transaction **fees get burned** to align scalability incentives - validators only get paid from fixed rewards pool and have no incentive to artificially constrain the network like in Bitcoin or Ethereum.
